        import {TestContract} from 'chaos-labs-utils/TestContract.sol';
        ...
        
        contract XXX is TestContract {

        uint256[] memory healthsBefore = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL);

        // 2. execute payload
        _executePayload(address(proposalPayload));

        uint256[] memory healthsAfter = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL);

        validateBorrowersHealth(healthsBefore, healthsAfter, 1_00);

    }
    ```

    ```_testBorrowrsHealth```

    this function get all borrowers health for the given protocol status.

    ```validateBorrowersHealth```

    this function compares the health of the borrowed before and after the execution for a given tolerance percentage (1_00 present +-1%, for zero tolerance pass 0)
